## 🛍️ Structured Queries from Natural Language - Online Products 📈
Are you ready to harness the power of natural language to find the perfect online products? 🌐💼 Look no further! In this project, we aim to create a robust system that takes user queries for specific products from a particular website (https://www.lamode.tn) and extracts relevant features to perform structured queries. 💡🔍

Here's how it works:

1. Users provide their product queries using natural language.
2. Our system extracts essential features from the query.
3. We use these features to perform structured queries on https://www.lamode.tn.
4. Voilà! The most relevant results are presented to the user.

With this powerful tool, finding the products you desire becomes a breeze! 🚀 Say goodbye to sifting through endless pages of search results. Let the magic of structured queries bring you the perfect match! 💫✨
